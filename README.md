# DRP
## Code for my Fall '21 Directed Reading Program at Berkeley and both semesters' presentations

The Directed Reading Program at Berkeley pairs the applicant (an undergraduate math student) with a mentor (a graduate math student). The undergrad reads a text at their own speed and creates a project/presentation at the end of the semester for their peers, and the mentor is there to answer any questions along the way.

The Fall DRP was more basic material, which meant I was actually able to code a small (albeit unoptimized) demo of bit commitment and zero-knowledge proofs, while the Spring DRP dove into more complex material, so I ended up only creating a presentation.
